CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Weakly Reciprocal

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among
hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the
freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs
and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open
Hardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and
two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S
(strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-W is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
unmodified form only.

Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any
Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in
their development.

1 Definitions

  1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-W.

  1.2 'Compatible Licence' means

       a) any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or

       b) any version of the CERN-OHL-S or the CERN-OHL-W, or

       c) any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which
          it applies as licensed under CERN-OHL-S or CERN-OHL-W
          provided that on Conveyance of any such Source, or any
          associated Product You treat the Source in question as being
          licensed under the applicable version of CERN-OHL-S or
          CERN-OHL-W as appropriate.

  1.3 'Source' means information such as design files, circuit or
      circuit board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and
      descriptive text, and other information which is explicitly or
      implicitly required for the reproduction of a Product.

  1.4 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available
      under this Licence.

  1.5 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object,
      whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use,
      application or processing of Covered Source.

  1.6 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by
      manufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered
      Source or another Product or otherwise.

  1.7 'Available Component' means any part, sub-assembly, library or
      code which:

       a) is licensed to You as Complete Source under a Compatible
          Licence; or

       b) is available, at the time a Product or the Source containing
          it is first Conveyed, to You and any other prospective
          licensees

            i) as a physical part with sufficient rights and
               information (including any configuration and
               programming files and information about its
               characteristics and interfaces) to enable it either to
               be Made itself, or to be sourced and used to Make the
               Product; or
           ii) as part of the normal distribution of a tool used to
               design or Make the Product.

  1.8 'Complete Source' means the set of all Source necessary to Make
      a Product, in the preferred form for making modifications,
      including necessary installation and interfacing information
      both for the Product, and for any included Available Components.
      If the format is proprietary, it must also be made available in
      a format (if the proprietary tool can create it) which is
      viewable with a tool available to potential licensees and
      licensed under a licence approved by the Free Software
      Foundation or the Open Source Initiative. Complete Source need
      not include the Source of any Available Component, provided that
      You include in the Complete Source sufficient information to
      enable a recipient to Make or source and use the Available
      Component to Make the Product.

  1.9 'Source Location' means a location where a Licensor has placed
      Covered Source, and which that Licensor reasonably believes will
      remain easily accessible for at least three years for anyone to
      obtain a digital copy.

 1.10 'Notice' means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices,
      Source Location references, modification notices (subsection
      3.3(b)) and all notices that refer to this Licence and to the
      disclaimer of warranties that are included in the Covered
      Source.

 1.11 'Licensee' or 'You' means any person exercising rights under
      this Licence.

 1.12 'Licensor' means a natural or legal person who creates or
      modifies Covered Source. A person may be a Licensee and a
      Licensor at the same time.

 1.13 'Convey' means to communicate to the public or distribute.

2 Applicability

  2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying
      of Covered Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By
      exercising any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably
      accept these terms and conditions.

  2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and
      shall apply worldwide and without limitation in time.

  2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract or otherwise the
      rights granted under this Licence to other Licensees.

  2.4 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing,
      or any other similar right.

3 Copying, Modifying and Conveying Covered Source

  3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in
      any medium, provided You retain all Notices.

  3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices, provided that
      You irrevocably undertake to make that modified Covered Source
      available from a Source Location should You Convey a Product in
      circumstances where the recipient does not otherwise receive a
      copy of the modified Covered Source. In each case subsection 3.3
      shall apply.

      You may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to
      the corresponding Covered Source as modified by You and You may
      add additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.
      Including Covered Source in a larger work is modifying the
      Covered Source, and the larger work becomes modified Covered
      Source.

  3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You
      also become a Licensor) provided that You:

       a) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2; and

       b) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You
          have modified it, with the date and brief description of how
          You have modified it.

      As an exception to the above, You need not provide a Source
      Location or Notice for a modification which

       i) alters only the mechanical dimensions, materials or similar
          characteristics of the Product; or

      ii) does not alter the electrical behaviour of the Product; or

     iii) makes it possible to Make the Product with an Available
          Component which is already compatible with the Covered
          Source.

  3.4 You may Convey Products made using Covered Source provided that
      You either provide each recipient with a copy of the Complete
      Source or ensure that each recipient is notified of the Source
      Location of the Complete Source. That Complete Source includes
      Covered Source and may include other Source. The other Source
      need not be Covered Source.

4 Making and Conveying Products

  You may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You either
  provide each recipient with a copy of the Complete Source or ensure
  that each recipient is notified of the Source Location of the
  Complete Source. That Complete Source includes Covered Source and may
  include other Source. The other Source need not be Covered Source.

5 Modifications by Licensees

  Subsection 3.2 shall not apply to a Licensee who Makes a Product by
  using Covered Source from more than one Licensor.

6 Notice

  You must cause any Product You Make using Covered Source to carry a
  Notice compatible with subsection 3.3(b).

7 Dispute Resolution

  Any legal disputes relating to this Licence shall be resolved by the
  courts of the jurisdiction where the Licensor resides or has his or
  her principal place of business.

8 Termination

  8.1 This Licence automatically terminates if You fail to comply with
      any of its terms and conditions.

  8.2 Any Product You Make after termination shall continue to be
      governed by this Licence. Nothing in this Licence shall be
      construed to restrict anyone from Making, using, Conveying or
      modifying any Product made before termination, or to restrict the
      use of Covered Source made available under this Licence.

9 Later licence versions

  CERN may publish revised and/or new versions of this Licence which
  retain the same general provisions as this version, but differ in
  detail so as to address new problems or concerns. Such new versions
  will be published with a unique version number and a variant
  identifier specifying the variant. If a piece of Covered Source does
  not specify a version number of this Licence or a variant identifier,
  the Licensor shall be deemed to have specified the latest version of
  CERN-OHL-W published at the time the Covered Source was modified or
  Conveyed by that Licensor.

  You may also choose to use a later version of this Licence if that
  version gives you additional or different permissions.

10 NO WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER

  10.1 COVERED SOURCE OR ANY PRODUCT MADE USING THE COVERED SOURCE IS
       PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
       INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
       MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL
       THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
       SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT
       LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF
       USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED
       AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT
       LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING
       IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE COVERED SOURCE OR THE MAKING
       OF A PRODUCT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
       DAMAGES.

  10.2 You represent and warrant that You will not use any Covered
       Source in a safety critical application. A safety critical
       application is one where failure of the system would directly
       result in death, personal injury, or severe environmental
       damage.
